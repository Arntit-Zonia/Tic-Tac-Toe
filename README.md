# Tic-Tac-Toe

Decided to create the Classic Tic-Tac-Toe game I used to play when I was younger.

The player will put his/her skills to the test against a computer controlled "AI".

The program will check if there are three X or O characters in a row either horizontally, vertically or diagonally,
if that is the case we have a winner!

The winning combination will be highlighted and the board will reset so a new game can be played straight away.

If after all 9 moves where made and there wasn't a winner the game will end in a draw, again resulting in the board resetting.
